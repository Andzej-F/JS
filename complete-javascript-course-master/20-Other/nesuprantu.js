Background
You have already been in a conversation with a client - they have requested to create a login for one of their colleagues.
Unfortunately, we had some delays and were somewhat slow with the answer. This is how they responded:

Hi,
About time with the login info, finally we can get John inside the platform.

In the mean time we’ve got even more issues! We’re testing out the different API endpoints(URLs) and my developer says
they’re getting some sort of error that the platform can’t handle so many requests at once?! 

What’s even more annoying is that the platform doesn’t say what are the limitations – how can we know what’s the limit on requests per second?

If we can move past this stage, next up will be figuring out how to set up a product retargeting campaign. I must say the
help section is very confusing – can you tell me what we should do?

Best,
Alex
p.s. I’ve just received this article from The Drum about Chrome killing 3rd party cookies, isn’t that like the backbone of
our business??? How are you planning to address this?
